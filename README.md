# Girl Scouts Gold Award
My Girl Scouts Gold Award Project is a website of an interactive map of the Guadalupe River Park Conservancy in San Jose, California. This map will allow people on the internet to learn specific facts or landmarks about the park. The map aims to educate people and allow people to explore the park without physically visiting it. My website will spread awareness about natural parks and the importance of this specific park.

## Overview 

I will explain the purpose of my Girl Scouts Project and explain what the Gold Scout Gold Award is. 

#### Girl Scout Gold Award
The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest award or achievement within the Girl Scouts organization. This project aims to encourage Girls Scouts to create sustainable projects to help or support their community.

#### Concept

My Girl Scout Gold Award Project will be an interactive map of the park, which displays the park's features and natural resources. People will use the interactive map to explore the park since these people may be unable to visit or discover the park. This map will need to be sustainable for all generations to be successfully educated and able to explore the park. The map also will effectively bring awareness or attention to the natural parks.  

#### About the Developer

I am a rising junior at the King's Academy in California. I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and going on hikes. I am doing this project to help bring awareness to parks and help others discover love or passion in nature. 

## Mockups

This section includes information about my design of this interactive map. These designs are just drafts of what I aim for website looks like.

 I decided to create a website with an interactive map in the center to entice the viewers. I then used a green color font for the title due to the matching logo's color. I had intended to create a website with a scroll function for viewers to scroll down and see a description about the Guadalupe River Park Conservancy. I also had red buttons that would display the landmarks of the park and make it easy for the viewers to explore and interact with the park.

#### Version 1.0.0

This image demonstrates the first version of my website. I have implemented a navigation bar instead of using a scroll function to organize all the information that I intend to include on my website. I have not come very far in my process of creating an interactive map; however, this image demonstrates the foundation for my website. 

## Libraries and Dependencies 

My libraries include W3 schools and Bootstrap. I have mostly used W3 schools for styling and adding images. I used Bootstrap and W3 schools for my navigation bar.

#### Bootstrap
