      <p>  The Rotary PlayGarden, the Rotary Club of San Jose’s centennial gift to our community, opened in May 2015. This PlayGarden provides a fun, amusing playground for kids to enjoy, while parents or others can watch them on the large chairs.  The $6 million PlayGarden enables children with special needs to play alongside their siblings and friends and is maintained by Guadalupe River Park Conservancy staff and volunteers, in-kind donations, and fee-for-service contracts. Due to its proximity to the San Jose Airport, the Rotary Play Garden prohibits the use of kites, balloons, drones, or any inflatables. In order to access this PlayGarden, people must follow new guidelines due to COVID.  Directions are <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5FFiawhoEKCAPaea7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="uk-modal-title"> Heritage Rose Garden</h2>
      <p>The San Jose Rose Heritage Garden, or the “Sangerhausen of the West,” is a hidden treasure. The beautiful rose garden helps preserve important rose species. From the Old Blush to Lane China, the garden contains varieties of species of flowers or roses with different colors and structures. Even though these roses are incredibly rare, the public has access to viewing and observing these special flowers. The original curator of the garden, Ed Wilkinson, has spent countless hours building the rose garden and exploring remote areas to gather unidentified species of roses. With over 3,000 varieties and more than 4,000 planted roses, the Heritage Rose Garden is the largest public collection of roses in the Western hemisphere.  Directions are <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QVuhixJhpjeAmomKA" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="uk-modal-title">Historic Orchard</h2>
      <p>The Historic Orchard is a 3.3-acre site planted in 1994 and located in Guadalupe Gardens just south of Taylor Street, adjacent to the Heritage Rose Garden and River Park trails. Today, with very few orchards remaining, this is a place where adults and children can come to experience a piece of local history. The trees that were harvested in the orchard before contributed to the fruit-picking economy or the business of fruit production. This orchard was planted with over 200 fruit trees: cherries, apricots, prunes, apples, and more, that were grown in the Valley over the last century. Fruit harvested from the Historic Orchard is donated to Second Harvest of Silicon Valley and local shelters.

              <p>My Girl Scouts Gold Award Project is a website of an interactive map of the Guadalupe River Park Conservancy in San Jose, California. This map will allow people on the internet to learn specific facts or landmarks about the park. The map aims to educate people and allow people to explore the park without physically visiting it. My website will spread awareness about natural parks and the importance of this specific park.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>My Girl Scout Gold Award Project will be an interactive map of the park, which displays the park's features and natural resources. People will use the interactive map to explore the park since these people may be unable to visit or discover the park. This map will need to be sustainable for all generations to be successfully educated and able to explore the park. </p>
